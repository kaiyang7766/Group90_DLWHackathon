## Problem Statement
In 2021, more than 54,000 adults in US were diagnosed with oral cancer. Of those diagnosed, an estimated 10,000 people has died, killing roughly 1 person per hour. Everyday, there will approximately 132 new individuals diagnosed with oral cancer. Worldwide the problem is much greater, there will more than 640,000 new cases happen each year. The death rate is particularly high not because it is hard to discover or diagnose, but due to the cancer being routinely discovered late in its development.
Warning signs of pre-cancerous growths and early oral cancers include ulcers, sores and red or white patches in the mouth which do not heal. But they are usually painless at this stage, so most people either ignore them or self-medicate using gels. As such, most patients are diagnosed at the later stages of oral cancer when it is more difficult to treat.

## Solution
DentalAnywhere is an image recognition sytem where it is able to identify oral conditions such as ulcers, inflamation, flurosis, providing a reference to users on their oral health. VGG-16 model, a transfer learning model will deployed due to limited training dataset.

## Objective
The objective of our solution is to design an image recognition sytem for everyone where they are able to check their oral health for free at their convenience. 

## What's next for DentalAnywhere
More dataset should be acquired to improve the accuracy. 

Built with Python
